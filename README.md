**Epitech project**

my_paint was the first graphical project of the second semester, you had to code it in C and use the CSFML.

The goal of the project is to create an image edition tool with pen and eraser tool.
In my project you can open, save, change color, change brush size, zoom, moving in the image with the hand tool.

**Usage**
```
./my_paint
```
